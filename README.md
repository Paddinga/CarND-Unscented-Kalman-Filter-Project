## Term 2 Project 2: Unscented Kalman Filters

The goal for this project was to implement an unscented Kalman filter using sensor fusion of RADAR and LIDAR. The project specification was given [here](https://review.udacity.com/#!/rubrics/783/view).

### Approach

This project was really close to the previous project implementing the extended Kalman filter. Again I used my modified install-mac.sh to install uWebSocketIO.

Implementing the unscented Kalman Filter was again pretty straight forward using the starter code and the code given in the courses. I just added the recommended NIS, which went well with the given documentation.

Compiling the code was sucessful and the simulation in the app ran with the first attempt.

### Challenges

Based on the first project there were no challenges that took extra time implementing the code.

### Conclusion

It was quite fun to extend the first project using sigma points.
